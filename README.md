# Dockerzone

[Dangerzone](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone) isn't available in most Linux distros repositories. 
Because of this, one has to add third party repos to their systems package manager, which is not exactly a safe 
thing to do. 


Alternatively, you can build it yourself. But like most large software projects, it has a lot of dependencies, creates 
a lot of temp folders, configurations and so on. If you are like me, you dislike chaos in your folders. 


That's why I created this project. By running the whole build and (soon) execution process in a container, your
files are left alone. And in order. 


I hope you enjoy!
